            <h3>What is your element CSS class?</h3>
            <p>I used h2.languages and table.skill as my element CSS classes. For the h2.languages I experimented with a 
            golden linear gradient style and used webkits background-clip feature to mask the gradient into the text. Also, I used 
            the table.skill to style the HTML table and change the font color and also center it
            </p>

            <h3>What is your global CSS class?</h3>
            <p>I used .profile and .describe as my global CSS classes. The .profile is used to style the profile image; I centered the image
                added some padding and also added a smooth shadow to the image to get some depth. The .describe is used to style the description I gave for myself (name, course, student number) </p>

            <h3>What are your HTML5-only tags?</h3>
            <p>The HTML-5 only tags I used on this page are main and footer</p>

            <h3>What are your CSS3-only features?</h3>
            <p>The CSS3-only features I used are the linear-gradient and the custom font features (used google fonts to import)</p>

            <h3>Did you use the same protection method? If no, what did you use this time?</h3>
            <p>Although I used a script tag in the header again for authentication; I was able to find a more effective and secure method using for loop in Javascript to keep the limits unlimited but also stops people from moving forward after one attempt. I was also able to use a string method to convert capital to small while parsing so user doesn't have to worry about it</p>

            <h3>How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)</h3>
            <p>This lab didn't take that long, but just to work around with some styling it took roughly 1-2 hours</p>
